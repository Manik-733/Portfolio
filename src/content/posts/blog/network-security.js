Entering the world of cybersecurity always felt like stepping into a vast, digital wilderness. This sense got magnified (by 10x atleast) when I embarked on one of my most ambitious projects yet—"Manik's Encryptor." This wasn't just a technical project; it was a personal challenge, a true test of my resolve and passion for cybersecurity. Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), this journey from concept to launch taught me the essence of patience and the power of community support in the face of challenges.

## The Idea of Manik’s Encryptor

The idea of Manik's Encryptor arose from a simple yet a very ambitious desire to make digital communication safer for everyone. A book I have been reading lately 'Big Breaches: Cybersecurity Lessons for Everyone' played a important role in this idea. Reading about more and more breaches made me realise all of this could be avoided if we just use encryption. Creating a user-friendly encryption service seemed not only useful but necessary. But as I would soon learn, transforming this idea into reality on a platform as powerful and complex as AWS was no small feat.

## Choosing Amazon Web Services for Deployment

I have always used Github or Vercel for my deployments (10/10 experience), but this time the project was different. As I was finishing my Python script for backend, I realised my old buddies won't be able to help me anymore. After a lot of research (5 mins) and advise from my friend Deeparsh, I decided to use AWS. However, as someone new to its environment, every step felt like deciphering a new language. Setting up the EC2 instances, managing IAM roles, and understanding VPC configurations—each task was no less than travelling a new road in the middle of the night without Apple Maps. The complexity of AWS was overwhelming at times, and I questioned my ability to handle such a sophisticated tool.

## Challenges and Triumphs

The journey was filled with challenges. There were times when I felt like giving up, staring at my computer screen, struggling with server timeouts and configuration errors. The complexity of deploying a secure encryption service on AWS tested, my limits. There were moments of doubt, frustration, and genuine fear of failure.

But with every error message that popped up, my resolve grew stronger. I learned to embrace these challenges, understanding that each setback was a lesson in disguise. Configuring SSL/TLS protocols or setting up the correct security group rules eventually turned from baffling tasks into victories. The breakthrough came one quiet night when, after countless trials, Manik's Encryptor finally went live. The joy of seeing it work smoothly and securely was indescribable—a mix of relief, pride, and a huge sense of accomplishment.

## My closing thoughts on this whole experience

This project taught me more than just technical skills; it was a profound journey of personal growth. Here are a few key takeaways:

**Embrace the Struggle:** Each technical hurdle sharpened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of cybersecurity.
\n**Lean on the Community:** I cannot overstate the importance of the AWS and cybersecurity communities. Their advice and support were crucial in overcoming the technical challenges.
\n**Persistence is Key:** The path to success is paved with failures. Each misstep taught me resilience and the importance of pushing forward, no matter how daunting the task.
